### Creating a Device Image and Running It in a Virtual Machine

1. **Create a Backup Image**: Use backup software to create a system image of your iOS device. For iOS, tools like iMazing can help create a complete backup of your device, including the OS state.

2. **Transfer the Image to a Virtual Machine**: Import this backup into a virtual machine like the ones provided by UTM for iOS. This process will allow you to emulate the current state of your iOS device within the VM.

### Mirroring Two iPhones
1. **Use Same Apple ID**: Sign both iPhones into the same Apple ID which allows them to share information, but this method is not ideal for master-slave control.

2. **Third-Party Apps**: Utilize third-party apps for screen mirroring such as ApowerMirror, as discussed earlier.

This setup lets you mirror the current state of one iPhone onto another and control them as if one is updating or manipulating the other. Tread lightly here, since emulating and mirroring devices can often push the boundaries of the OS security features.
