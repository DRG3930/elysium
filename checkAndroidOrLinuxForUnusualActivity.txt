1. **Check for Unknown Apps**: Verify if there are any unfamiliar apps installed on your phone. In Termux (Android Linux shell), you can list installed packages using:
   ```sh
   pm list packages -3
   ```
   This command lists all third-party packages on your device.

2. **Monitor System Logs**: Use the `logcat` command in Termux to monitor logs:
   ```sh
   logcat
   ```
   Look for any suspicious activity or unfamiliar services.

3. **Network Usage**: Monitor data usage for unusual spikes. Use:
   ```sh
   iftop -i [interface]
   ```
   This command helps to see the real-time network traffic on your device.

4. **File System Changes**: Check for recently modified files:
   ```sh
   find / -mtime -1
   ```
   This lists files modified in the past day.

5. **Battery and Data Indicators**: Be aware of unusual battery drain and data usage, which could suggest unauthorized background activities.

6. **Permissions Review**: Check permissions granted to apps:
   ```sh
   appops
   ```

7. **Run a Malware Scan**: Use a reputable antivirus or anti-spyware app to scan for potential threats.

Additionally, enabling **Developer Options** and regularly reviewing activities can also help you stay ahead of any suspicious apps or services.
